A couple of days ago I stumpled upon [blogdown](https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown) and I was immediatly convinced to transition from WordPress to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a static website generator, with its help. Thanks to the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) the setup was easy: it took me about a day's work. However, the migration from WordPress to Hugo via Jekyll using the Python tool [exitwp](https://github.com/thomasf/exitwp) did not fully succeed (I lost all the comments). Since I did not want to spend too much time on this problem, I decided to leave [my old WordPress website](http://samboh.blogs.dsv.su.se/) and start anew with Hugo. Once everything is set up and running, the work process is really smooth and enjoyable. Hugoâ€™s is extremely fast and takes the fun back into site-building. Writing text in markdown and deploying with git is how I as a computer scientist like to make content. 

In a nutshell, this is my work process: 

1. Blogdown: I write all blog posts in [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) using [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/). 
2. GitHub: Then, I push all new content to my-personal-website repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/samuel-bohman/my-personal-website).
3. Netlify: Each time new content is pushed to GitHub, Netlify automatically updates [my new website](https://samuel.netlify.com/) (this one!) through a webhook. It only takes about 10 seconds or so for the new content to be generated.
