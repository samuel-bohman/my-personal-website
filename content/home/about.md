# About me

My research interests include statistical computing, machine learning, data visualization, literate programming, and reproducible research. I am passionate about open source software, in particular [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), an interpreted computer language and environment for statistical computing and graphics. Some of my favorite tools include the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) and the [tidyverse](http://tidyverse.org/) collection of R packages. You can find my profile on  [StackExchange](https://stackexchange.com/users/7449689/samuel?tab=accounts) and [RStudio Community](https://community.rstudio.com/u/samuel/summary).
