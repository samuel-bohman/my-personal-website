# About me

I am PhD student in the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University. I am passionate about statistics, computing, and programming. Prior to my PhD studies, I was a research assistant at the Institute for Futures Studies, an independent research institute based in Stockholm. This is my personal website with a collection of articles, projects, tutorials, and my own experiments with data.
