# About me

My name is Samuel Bohman and I am studying for my doctoral degree in computer science at Stockholm University. I primarily rely on R as my data science workbench, but I am always on the lookout for new languages and tech that will expand my toolset. Currently I have my eyes on Python and GPU accelerated machine learning with NVIDIA Cuda. This is my personal website where you will find blog posts, articles, projects, and tutorials.
