# Hello!

I'm Samuel, a PhD student in the Department of Computer and Systems Sciences, Stockholm University. I am passionated about finding insights in data through statistical techniques and machine learning methods and presenting those insights to decision-makers and non-technical audiences. Prior to my PhD studies, I was a research assistant at the [Institute for Futures Studies](http://www.iffs.se/en/), an independent research institute based in Stockholm. This is my personal website with a collection of articles, projects, tutorials, and my own experiments with data.
