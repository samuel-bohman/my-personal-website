The philosophy of the Wolfram Language is to automate as much as possible, so programmers can concentrate on defining what they want to do, and the language will automatically figure out how to do it. The Wolfram Language represents everything—data, formulas, code, graphics, documents, interfaces, etc.—as symbolic expressions, making possible a new level of programming flexibility and power. Built into the Wolfram Language are "notebook" documents that mix executable code with text, graphics, interfaces, and more.
